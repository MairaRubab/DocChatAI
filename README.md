# DocChatAI: Intelligent Document Assistant for Efficient Information Retrieval


DocChatAI is an advanced web application that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries based on the content of uploaded PDF documents.

# Features

1. Document Upload: Users have the option to upload PDF documents which the app will utilize as additional context for generating answers.
2. Chat Box: Ask questions and receive contexually relevant & accurate answers, with insights pulled directly from the uploaded PDFs.
3. Download Conversation: Before resetting the session, users can download a PDF of the conversation, including all interactions and responses generated from the uploaded documents. This feature ensures that users can retain a complete record of the session's context for future reference.
4. Reset Button: This feature clears the chat history and removes all uploaded documents from backend storage. To start a new session, users will need to re-upload the documents.
